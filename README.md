### Why should you use Guitar Diagrams JS?

Guitar Diagrams JS is intended for instructional content developers publishing their own sites with musical instruction related to scales and chords for stringed instruments. It's a called Guitar Diagrams JS because the primary use is for guitarists, but it can also be used for bass, banjo, mandolin, dobro, violin (or fiddle), viola, cello, ukulele, and more!

The benefit of Guitar Diagrams JS is that it provides a visual representation of the instrument without requiring the content creator to design images graphically, download them, and embed them in HTML. The Guitar Diagrams JS library empowers you to create consistent scale and chord diagrams without ever needing to open a graphics program.
